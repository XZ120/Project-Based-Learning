# Indonesia's Fresh Graduates Job Market

I'll enter the labor market and want to work smarter to finding interesting and passionate jobs.
Therefore,  I make scraper script to collect and parseout jobs posting data in order to get well insight and **reduce asymetric information**.
The job posting usually contains the job description, location, job requirements, nor salary offer (even usually they don't publish). 
Based on that information alone, we can get a general picture of what is requirements often needed, 
what kind of skills well to have for job seekers, nor market price of the wage we will pay. 
This would increase our competitiveness among other job seekers because we well informed and can get ready with the usual requirements submitted.

Even so, another story about the trigger I made for this personal project was a [viral tweet](https://twitter.com/romeogadungan/status/1212620721232302080)
that suggested that we have a certain skill to get add value in the eyes of the employer. As a skeptical person, 
I do not necessarily immediately trust, even though he (who has twit) has a pretty good reputation. 
I try to do a little bit labor market research for fresh graduates in Indonesia,  both high school and college graduates. 
The data is obtained from [Indeed](https://www.indeed.com/) which is one of the easiest job portals to scrapped.
Below are some of the results of my research. 

First is the keywords that often appear in the post description. 
It is very clear that the degree is still the main requirement in the employer screening process. And and majors that are usually 
the favorites of prospective college students, i.e. management, business, communication, are still selling well in the market today.
Moreover, the many skills displayed are more likely to be in general soft skills, for example being able to work with teams communication. 
This is in line with the survey results from Linkedin. In short, the viral tweet can be said to be partially incorrect based on the data.
