**Abstract:** The age structure of Indonesia's population will be highly dominated by productive age groups. However, the proportion of young people classified as not working, educating or attending training (NEET) is one of the highest (23.2%) in the Asian Region. The accumulation of social losses that result can eliminate the opportunity to create economic benefits in the future because they do not accumulate human capital (Quintano, Mazzocchi, & Rocca, 2018). Even though, they have privileged families who voluntarily support. The study will focus on exploring this kind of youth subgroup which rarely get the researchers attention. We try to link the relationship between a young man's decision to become a NEET and his reservation wage. We hypothesize that their probability of being NEET will be higher along with the increase in the wealth of his parents or family. This is possible together with Indonesia's income rapidly increase last decades. *Preliminary findings*: Yet, we did not find significant evidence to support our hypothesis. Even, a wealthy youth who graduated from senior high school or college education  can afford to not engage in employment or education. They tend to choose to pursue higher education. Although, their school performance is low. On the other hand, most of these youth NEET are married women with family responsibilities, such as child-care nor culture demands. The eï¬€ect can be mitigated by education, as women with a university degree have a lower chance of falling in the NEET group (Contini, Filandri, & Pacelli, 2019).{align=center}
